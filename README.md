#### Project Objective:

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately detecting fake news articles. 
By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, the model will analyze textual features of news articles to identify patterns indicative of fake news.

#### Machine Learning Models:

The following machine learning algorithms will be explored and compared:

## Decision Trees (DT): A simple yet effective algorithm that creates a tree-like model of decisions to classify data.
## Random Forest (RF): An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
## Random Forest Classifier (RFC): Similar to RF but specifically designed for classification tasks.
## Logistic Regression (LR): A statistical model that predicts the probability of belonging to a particular class.

#### Model Evaluation:

The performance of each model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as:

## Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
## Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.
## Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly predicted as positive. Â  
## F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
